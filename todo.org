* 25.10.2020:
** TODO Fitness fkt
*** TODO Plott fittnessfnkt
*** TODO Norm time and occ
**** TODO Introduce lower bound by calculated the optimal minimal time and coverage
** TODO OCC alternative implementation -> look up opencv for mare alternatives (maybe polygone)
*** DONE Search for new draw line method
*** TODO Implement more precise line thickness
**** DONE Implement orthogonal calculation
**** DONE Use points from orthogonal vector as startpoints for complete coverage -> Current approach not feasable
**** TODO Benchmark hashmap against array according to access and summation time
** TODO Object avoidance
*** TODO introduce check for invalid paths (that will move over obstacles)
*** TODO Differentiate between different speed levels
*** TODO Introduvce difference between point shift and rotation


* 28.10.2020
** DONE Implement new fitness funktion and evaluate
** DONE Fix timer by introducing a stack
** TODO

* 26.11.2020
** TODO Robot
*** TODO Execution function to process action on grid map
*** TODO Processing of the individual actions
**** TODO Ahead/Cahead
**** TODO Start: get start parameter for all following actions
**** TODO End: Perform A* or similar to find the shortest path to the next endpoint
** DONE PathAction
*** DONE generator function to compute path
*** DONE Start action to give start direction and point
*** DONE End action, lists possible endpoints
** TODO PAModifier
*** TODO should also function as initializer for different path actions
*** TODO get a clomplete configuration or initialize actions randomly
** TODO GridMap
*** TODO Scale the map to the robots dimensions before working on it
Possibly be done in the robot constructor
*** TODO Initialize obstacle map (which needs to be scaled down too)
